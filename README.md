SurfHeaven.eu userscript that adds extra features to the page.

[Profile page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1765167/220740185-802ba381-c9b9-4afa-9bae-938ba87e3e19.png):

[Map page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1765167/221271072-1a0d2a01-696e-4981-9f2a-5c346ee4632e.png):
 - Show your map rank and time in map page  
 - CP Chart
 - Map picture cover (pictures from  https://github.com/Sayt123/SurfMapPics)

### Issues
 - First time running, all flags might not load, as the api doesnt like getting railed quite that hard
 - Uncached player flags might appear twice before the user is cached, refresh the page and they should go away ~~should be fixed~~ (not fixed)
 - If your scores/ranks/stats seem wrong, set your ID manually in the servers page
 - for other shit, let me know

#### Stuff i'll probably add in the future:
 - Map favorites
 - Map notes
 - points per map in profile
 - points per rank in map page
 - Player comparison
 - Add rank to map search results
 - points/rank to rankup in profile (25k, 15k, 6k, 3k, 1500, 1k, 750, 500, 250, 150, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 3, 2 ,1)
 - Points chart history in profile would go hard
 - Other stuff that comes to my mind, or that people request
