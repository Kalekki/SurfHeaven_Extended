### Issues
 - If your scores/ranks/stats seem wrong, set your ID manually in the servers page  
   - ID can be found on your profile page.  
   - Example: https://surfheaven.eu/player/21889731  
   - ID is 21889731  

 - If the script isn't working, and youre on Chrome, make sure you have developer mode enabled
 - Otherwise check browser console for errors and dm me or make an issue
