SurfHeaven.eu userscript that adds extra features to the page.

Server page ranks from the [original SH ranks](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/438271-surfheaven-ranks) userscript by Link is included.

### Extra features

Player flags everywhere!

Dashboard:
 - Country Top 100 list

Profile page:
 - Completions by tier
 - Show total completions of a maps and bonuses in uncompleted list 
 - Crank in profile  
 - Time spent in spec and loc  
 - Steam avatar :)

Map page:
 - Show your map rank and time in map page  
 - CP Chart

### Issues
 - First time running, all flags might not load, as the api doesnt like getting railed quite that hard
 - Uncached player flags might double in servers page, refresh the page and they should go away
 - If your scores/ranks/stats seem wrong, set your ID manually in the servers page
 - for other shit, let me know

#### Stuff i'll probably add in the future:
 - Error toasts
 - points per map in profile
 - points per rank in map page
 - Map favorites
 - Map notes
 - Player comparison
 - Adding friends and highlighting them in the server list
 - Add rank to map search results
 - points/rank to rankup in profile (25k, 15k, 6k, 3k, 1500, 1k, 750, 500, 250, 150, 100, 75, 50, 25, 10, 3, 2 ,1)
 - Points chart history in profile would go hard
 - Other stuff that comes to my mind, or that people request
